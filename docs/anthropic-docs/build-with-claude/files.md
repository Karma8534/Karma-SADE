# Files API

---

The Files API lets you upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without re-uploading content with each request. This is particularly useful when using the code execution tool to provide inputs (e.g. datasets and documents) and then download outputs (e.g. charts). You can also use the Files API to prevent having to continually re-upload frequently used documents and images across multiple API calls.

> The Files API is in beta. Include the beta header `anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14` to use this feature.

> This feature is in beta and is **not** eligible for Zero Data Retention (ZDR). Beta features are excluded from ZDR.

## Supported models

Referencing a `file_id` in a Messages request is supported in all models that support the given file type. Images are supported in all Claude 3+ models, PDFs in all Claude 3.5+ models, and various other file types for the code execution tool in Claude Haiku 4.5 plus all Claude 3.7+ models.

The Files API is currently not supported on Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI.

## How the Files API works

- **Upload files** to Anthropic's secure storage and receive a unique `file_id`
- **Download files** that are created from skills or the code execution tool
- **Reference files** in Messages requests using the `file_id` instead of re-uploading content
- **Manage your files** with list, retrieve, and delete operations

## Uploading a file

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/document.pdf"
```

```python
uploaded = client.beta.files.upload(
    file=("document.pdf", open("/path/to/document.pdf", "rb"), "application/pdf"),
)
```

The response from uploading a file will include:

```json
{
  "id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w",
  "type": "file",
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf",
  "size_bytes": 1024000,
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "downloadable": false
}
```

## Using a file in messages

Once uploaded, reference the file using its `file_id`:

```python
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Please summarize this document for me."},
                {
                    "type": "document",
                    "source": {
                        "type": "file",
                        "file_id": file_id,
                    },
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"],
)
```

## File types and content blocks

| File Type | MIME Type | Content Block Type | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PDF | `application/pdf` | `document` | Text analysis, document processing |
| Plain text | `text/plain` | `document` | Text analysis, processing |
| Images | `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp` | `image` | Image analysis, visual tasks |
| Datasets, others | Varies | `container_upload` | Analyze data, create visualizations |

### Document blocks

For PDFs and text files, use the `document` content block:

```json
{
  "type": "document",
  "source": {
    "type": "file",
    "file_id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w"
  },
  "title": "Document Title",
  "context": "Context about the document",
  "citations": { "enabled": true }
}
```

### Image blocks

For images, use the `image` content block:

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "source": {
    "type": "file",
    "file_id": "file_011CPMxVD3fHLUhvTqtsQA5w"
  }
}
```

## Managing files

### List files

```python
files = client.beta.files.list()
```

### Get file metadata

```python
file = client.beta.files.retrieve_metadata(file_id)
```

### Delete a file

```python
result = client.beta.files.delete(file_id)
```

### Downloading a file

Download files created by skills or the code execution tool:

```python
file_content = client.beta.files.download(file_id)

# Save to file
file_content.write_to_file("downloaded_file.txt")
```

> You can only download files that were created by skills or the code execution tool. Files that you uploaded cannot be downloaded.

## File storage and limits

### Storage limits

- **Maximum file size:** 500 MB per file
- **Total storage:** 500 GB per organization

### File lifecycle

- Files are scoped to the workspace of the API key
- Files persist until you delete them
- Deleted files cannot be recovered
- Files that users delete will be deleted in accordance with Anthropic's data retention policy

---

## Error handling

Common errors when using the Files API include:

- **File not found (404):** The specified `file_id` doesn't exist or you don't have access to it
- **Invalid file type (400):** The file type doesn't match the content block type
- **Exceeds context window size (400):** The file is larger than the context window size
- **Invalid filename (400):** Filename doesn't meet length requirements (1-255 characters) or contains forbidden characters
- **File too large (413):** File exceeds the 500 MB limit
- **Storage limit exceeded (403):** Your organization has reached the 500 GB storage limit

## Usage and billing

File API operations are **free**:
- Uploading files
- Downloading files
- Listing files
- Getting file metadata
- Deleting files

File content used in Messages requests are priced as input tokens. You can only download files created by skills or the code execution tool.

### Rate limits

During the beta period:
- File-related API calls are limited to approximately 100 requests per minute
