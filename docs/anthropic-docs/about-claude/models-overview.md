# Models overview

Claude is a family of state-of-the-art large language models developed by Anthropic. This guide introduces the available models and compares their performance.

---

## Choosing a model

If you're unsure which model to use, consider starting with **Claude Opus 4.6** for the most complex tasks. It is the latest generation model with exceptional performance in coding and reasoning.

All current Claude models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, and vision. Models are available via the Claude API, AWS Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.

Once you've picked a model, [learn how to make your first API call](/docs/en/get-started).

### Latest models comparison

| Feature | Claude Opus 4.6 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Claude Haiku 4.5 |
|:--------|:----------------|:------------------|:-----------------|
| **Description** | The most intelligent model for building agents and coding | The best combination of speed and intelligence | The fastest model with near-frontier intelligence |
| **Claude API ID** | claude-opus-4-6 | claude-sonnet-4-6 | claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 |
| **Claude API alias** | claude-opus-4-6 | claude-sonnet-4-6 | claude-haiku-4-5 |
| **AWS Bedrock ID** | anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 | anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6 | anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0 |
| **GCP Vertex AI ID** | claude-opus-4-6 | claude-sonnet-4-6 | claude-haiku-4-5@20251001 |
| **Pricing** | $5 / input MTok / $25 / output MTok | $3 / input MTok / $15 / output MTok | $1 / input MTok / $5 / output MTok |
| **Extended thinking** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Adaptive thinking** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Priority Tier** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Comparative latency** | Moderate | Fast | Fastest |
| **Context window** | 1M tokens | 1M tokens | 200k tokens |
| **Max output** | 128k tokens | 64k tokens | 64k tokens |
| **Reliable knowledge cutoff** | May 2025 | Aug 2025 | Feb 2025 |
| **Training data cutoff** | Aug 2025 | Jan 2026 | Jul 2025 |

> Models with the same snapshot date (e.g., 20240620) are identical across all platforms and do not change. The snapshot date in the model name ensures consistency and allows developers to rely on stable performance across different environments.

> Starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5 and all subsequent models** (including Claude Sonnet 4.6), AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI offer two endpoint types: **global endpoints** (dynamic routing for maximum availability) and **regional endpoints** (guaranteed data routing through specific geographic regions).

You can query model capabilities and token limits programmatically with the Models API. The response includes `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`, and a `capabilities` object for every available model.

### Legacy models

The following models are still available. Consider migrating to current models for improved performance:

| Feature | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Claude Opus 4.5 | Claude Opus 4.1 | Claude Sonnet 4 | Claude Opus 4 | Claude Haiku 3 (deprecated) |
|:--------|:------------------|:----------------|:----------------|:----------------|:--------------|:----------------------------|
| **Claude API ID** | claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | claude-opus-4-5-20251101 | claude-opus-4-1-20250805 | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | claude-opus-4-20250514 | claude-3-haiku-20240307 |
| **Pricing** | $3/$15 per MTok | $5/$25 per MTok | $15/$75 per MTok | $3/$15 per MTok | $15/$75 per MTok | $0.25/$1.25 per MTok |
| **Extended thinking** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Comparative latency** | Fast | Moderate | Moderate | Fast | Moderate | Fast |
| **Context window** | 1M (or 200k) tokens | 200k tokens | 200k tokens | 1M (or 200k) tokens | 200k tokens | 200k tokens |
| **Max output** | 64k tokens | 64k tokens | 32k tokens | 64k tokens | 32k tokens | 4k tokens |

> **Warning:** Claude Haiku 3 (`claude-3-haiku-20240307`) is deprecated and will be retired on April 19, 2026. Migrate to Claude Haiku 4.5 before the retirement date.

## Prompt and output performance

Claude 4 models excel in:
- **Performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing.
- **Engaging responses**: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.
- **Output quality**: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.

## Migrating to Claude 4.6

If you're currently using older Claude models, consider migrating to Claude Opus 4.6 to take advantage of improved intelligence and enhanced capabilities. For detailed migration instructions, see [Migrating to Claude 4.6](/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide).
